# rudimentar-cpp-tester
This is a shell script to compile and run tests of cpp programs. I use when I'm solving algorithms problems like the ones from https://www.dailycodingproblem.com/ or https://www.urionlinejudge.com.br/, for example.

## TODO
* Describe how to configure and set on ubuntu
* Add more validation before running tests
